One fist of soil by ayan rezaei 

My project is a public plaza. For creating this plaza, I am asking you around the world to send me one fist of soil. Metaphorically, each of the contributors would authorize me to build the plaza; each fist of soil signifies this authorization from another inhabitant of this earth. You can send me the soil that you feel most attached to. Each portion will represent a specific identity, culture, story and myth. In spite of all that, All soils are be mixed on the plaza and be given a completely new identity. They will be washed from all differences and contrasts. They are not bear the past anymore. The future will determine their identity.
