											I am Iranian. I was born, grew up and studied in Tehran. I
											came to Austria in October 2015 to continue my studies in art
											and architecture and joined the master program in Kunst
											Universitat Linz, Raum und Design Strategy. Due to the
											refugee crisis in 2015 in Europa, the main title of the year in
											our department is Not Welcome. Our mission is to find our
											position in this crisis and express it with our artworks.
											I am from an origin out of Europe. How can I decide to
											welcome or not welcome, when I am not the host? This
											question came up in the first encounter with the subject.
											Assuming a position between welcome or not welcome was
											nonsensical for me. When I came to Austria as an art student,
											I had the desire to take action as an adherent of the welcoming
											debate. However, the main question that occurred to me once
											I had settled in Austria was, how this could be at all possible
											when I am not the host? After a while, I decided to assume the
											same point of view as the refugees. I am familiar with their
											pains and have doubtless sympathy. We are grains of the
											same soil.<br/>
											I aim to take a position as a member of this group, and find a
											way to communicate with the host: the Austrian citizens.
											So I started looking for mutual attachments, common senses,
											or common memories. I searched for something that can
											simply connect us. I liked to find a way to share empathy
											regardless of governmental decision for dealing with the
											refugee crisis. Llike when Austrians spontaneously said
											welcome to refugees when they crossed the borders to
											Austria.<br/>
											I choose Soil. Soil as a powerful medium that simply reminds
											us of being on earth, as human kind.<br/>
											Within this call, I ask you to add one fist of soil to the soil that
											the refugees have carried from land to land on their shoes and
											clothes. By mixing them, we will build a piece of a dream land
											where they can share art, culture and feelings with their host.
											<br/><br/>
											At first place, I would thank Mr. Ton Motton to give me the
											chance to participate to the program and help me with this
											project. Also wise guidance from Mr. Michaeal Obrist is always
											helped me to advance my vision.<br/>
											Shahrzad Irannejad, Carina Nimmervoll, Eyad Haddad,
											Ardavan Khorsand, Franziska Schink, Christian Schrenk and
											Ute Hackl, thank you so much for your generous help and
											support.
